      Due to CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures on the Earth have risen rapidly in the last 100 years. 
      This has lead to rising sea levels and the threat of displacement for many people, including the destruction of homes.
      For example, in Bangladesh 28% of the population lives in coastal cities; it is estimated that by 2050 1 in 7 people will
      have been displaced due to climate change.
