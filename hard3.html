There are many effects of worsening drought due to climate change which can affect extensive areas. 
      Lack of drinking water, loss of farmland, and loss of livestock can have a potentially deadly 
      effect on the human population. Drought also leads to more and longer wildfires, destroying millions 
      of acres of forests each year.
